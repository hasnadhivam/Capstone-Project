## Background Story:
We created SafeHeart with the intention of bringing solutions to heart disease risk with symptoms or without symptom problems in Indonesia. SafeHeart offers a classification feature for heart disease risk categories, with individual classification categories into high, medium, or low-risk categories, based on age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, smoking status, and other relevant health factors. With these features, SafeHeart needs machine learning assistance using a classification model that can accurately predict the risk of heart disease based on the given health parameters.
